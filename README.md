# crown-clothing

My repo for the ZTM React Developer course: https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/

This repo covers the Crown Clothing project in the course.

The purpose of this repo is for students to have an additional source to check their code against (in addition to the instructor's original source code).

Some quick and easy initial troubleshooting steps

- Clone either my repo or the instructor's and run it locally to rule out any errors due to outdated code.
- Compare your code utilizing a tool like https://www.diffchecker.com/. DO NOT DO IT MANUALLY.
- Most issues are because of typos so do keep that in mind :)
